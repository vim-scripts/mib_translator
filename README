CHANGELOG:
0.0.4, 2010-04-12
- Fixed: If the opened buffer is deleted by hand, that raised an error when the buffer is opened again.
0.0.3, 2010-04-12
- Fixed: Opened buffer remained unmodifiable for the second run.
0.0.2, 2010-04-12
- The opened buffer is colored with MIB file syntax, making it more readable.
- The opened buffer is not modifiable from now on.
- Made it more compatible with other plugins, the functions starts with 's:'.
0.0.1, 2009-12-04
- First version with forward and reverse OID translation

COMMANDS:
  :OidReverseTranslate <oidName>
    Displays the OID information if the OID name is given. This is the reverse translation.
    :OidReverseTranslate ipv6MIB
  :OidTranslate <oidNumber>
    Displays the OID information if the OID number is given. This is the forward translation.
    :OidTranslate .1.3.6.1.2.1.55

USAGE:
  You can use the plugin as the COMMANDS section shows.
  Note that you do not have to open a MIB file to use this plugin.
  It will work anyway, but if you open a MIB file, you can use as:
    1. Get the cursor to a OID name, for example ipv6MIB.
    2. Type : to get to command mode.
    3. Type OidReverseTranslate
    4. Type <space>
    5. Type <C-r> <C-w>
    6. Press <enter>


CONFIGURATION:
  The options are:

  g:OidTranslatorBufferName:
    The name of the MIB translator buffer.
    The tranlated values will be displayed here.
    There is no need to change this if there are no clash with another plugin.
    Default is 'OIDTranslator'.

  g:OidTranslatorBufferSize:
    The size of the buffer. It is the line count. If your screen is small, you can reduce the this size, or if your screen is huge, you can raise this number.
    Default is 10.

  g:SnmpTranslatePath:
    The executable path of the snmptranslate command of Net-SNMP.
    If the bin folder is in your path, no need to change this setting.
    If it is not, set this option from your VIMRC.
    The value must the path to the executable, not the directory including the executable.
    For example, a valid value is:
    let g:SnmpTranslatePath = 'C:\\usr\\bin\\snmptranslate.exe'
    The default value is 'snmptranslate', so that it can directly run without modification if snmptranslate is included in a directory on path.
    Note that if Net-SNMP is not on the path, even though you define this option correct, snmptranslate itself can have difficulties to find the MIB files, so it is recommended to keep it on the path and not changing this option.

REQUIREMENTS:
  - Net-SNMP package must be installed on your system.
    http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/
    It is also strongly recommended to add 'C:\usr\bin' to the path in Windows.
